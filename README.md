A sophisticated system designed to streamline the management of driving licenses using a 3-tier architecture. It automates the testing process for various aspects such as psychoanalysis, vision, written tests, and driving skills, and handles the renewal and issuance of both local and international licenses. Developed using C# with the .NET Framework, this system leverages SQL Server for robust data management and T-SQL for advanced querying. The user interface is built with Windows Forms, and data operations are handled via ADO.NET, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience. Additionally, there is a version of the project with a backend implemented as a RESTful API using .NET Core.
